# ## Logging

# For logging we want to prefix each entry with the current time, as well
# as the process name. This takes two arguments, the name of the process
# with its index, and then reads data from stdin, formats it, and sends it
# to stdout and dev.log.
log() {
  local index="$2"
  local format="%s %s\t| %s"
  local log_format="%s %s\t| %s"
  
  # Maximum log line length (configurable via environment variable)
  local max_length="${MAX_LOG_LINE_LENGTH:-500}"

  # We add colors when output is a terminal. `SHOREMAN_COLORS` can override it.
  if [ -t 1 -o "$SHOREMAN_COLORS" == "always" ] \
     && [ "$SHOREMAN_COLORS" != "never" ]; then
    # Bash colors start from 31 up to 37. We calculate what color the process
    # gets based on its index.
    local color="$((31 + (index % 7)))"
    format="\033[0;${color}m%s %s\t|\033[0m %s"

# ## Running commands

# When a process is started, we want to keep track of its pid so we can
# `kill` it when the parent process receives a signal, and so we can `wait`
# for it to finish before exiting the parent process.

# later on in the script.

# The file is given on stdin, see the `<` at the end of this while loop.
